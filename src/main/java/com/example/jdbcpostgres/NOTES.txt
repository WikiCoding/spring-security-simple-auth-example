Important logic details:

1 - User model creation. It can be a Record or a normal Class. It can also implement UserDetails interface but it's not a Requirement

2 - @Repository UserRepository creation for the Database Access layer
2.1 - Inside of this repository it's needed a mapRow static method that takes in a (ResultSet rs, int rowNumber)
and returns a new User object in order to populate properly the query results.
2.2 - In the repository we don't have Beans, just plain methods.

3 - @Service UserService creation which implements UserDetailsService interface to work along with the AuthenticationManager in the background
3.1 - by implementing the @Override loadUserByUsername method we will return new UserDetails overriding all its methods.
3.2 - if there are any authorities we can define them here.

4 - @Service AuthService creation to handle logic like password encryption and issue authentication tokens. @Transaction to work with transactions

5 - @Component JwtAuthFilter and @Service JwtService creation to handle token creation and filtering for authenticated users
5.1 - the JwtAuthFilter extends OncePerRequest, so it runs the filter on every request. After this filter it will go to the SecurityFilterChain

6 - @Component SecurityConfiguration creation to create http filters on certain endpoints, define roles,... and store
the @Bean for the AuthenticationManager method and the @Bean for the PasswordEncoder method
6.1 - the AuthenticationManager takes in UserDetailsService as it's only argument
6.2 - here we first need to define a new DaoAuthenticationProvider object
6.3 - then to this new object we setUserDetailsService with our UserDetailsService and we setPasswordEncoder with our encoder.
6.4 - we implement the @Bean SecurityFilterChain with the HttpSecurity as the only Argument, so we define the http filters
6.5 - the roles have to be defined in upperCase

7 - Then just create the @RestController with @RequestMapping, creating an instance of AuthService and start using the endpoints!
